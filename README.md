The repository is related to the "Introduction to parallel programming" course held at the University of Trento

---

## Objectives

The project aims to analyze and benchmark the performance variations between sequential and parallel C++ implementations of the Sparse Matrix - Vector Multiplication (SpMV) algorithm, using the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format.

The analysis is structured across two main deliverables, comparing the baseline sequential code against various parallel implementations to evaluate speedup, efficiency, and scalability.

## Environment

All the performance tests and profiles are conducted on the Univesrity of Trento's HPC cluster.
