# SpMV Kernel Optimization

The repository is related to the _"Introduction to parallel programming"_ course held at the University of Trento

---

## Objectives

The project aims to analyze and benchmark the performance variations between sequential and parallel `C++` implementations of the **Sparse Matrix - Vector Multiplication** (**_SpMV_**) algorithm, using the **Compressed Sparse Row** (_**CSR**_) format.

---

## Technology

The code parallelization is achieved via **OpenMP on shared-memory system**.

Navigate to the openmp [folder](openmp) for further information

--- 

## Environment

All the performance tests and profiles are conducted on the **University of Trento's HPC cluster**.
