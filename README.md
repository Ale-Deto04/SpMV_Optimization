The repository is related to the "Introduction to parallel programming" course held at the University of Trento

---

## Objectives

The project aims to analyze and benchmark the performance variations between sequential and parallel C++ implementations of the Sparse Matrix - Vector Multiplication (SpMV) algorithm, using the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format.

---

## Technology

The code parallelization is achieved via OpenMP on shared-memory system.

--- 

## Environment

All the performance tests and profiles are conducted on the University of Trento's HPC cluster.
